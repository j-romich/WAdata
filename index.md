About the Washington Merged Longitudinal Administrative Data

The Washington Merged Longitudinal Administrative Data (WMLAD) is a novel data resource comprising longitudinal and geocoded administrative records from seven Washington state agencies. A single unique person identifier links all records, allowing researchers to merge information from different state agencies and follow individuals over time. All datasets cover the period 2010-2016, with some covering longer periods. Together, these records contain information on over 10 million individuals, closely approximating Census counts of working-age Washingtonians.
